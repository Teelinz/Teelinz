-Hi, I’m @Teelinz
-I am a complete noob and I’m interested in understanding how to read code and understand how to differentiate between different languages, if even applicable (if this is all open scource, maybe its all the same??)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I know less than nothing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to help a team with product improvement, new idea, marketing and sales.
